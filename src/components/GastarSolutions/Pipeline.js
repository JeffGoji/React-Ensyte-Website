                            <p>The GASTAR Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) supports nominations, scheduling, shipper notices, shipper measurement information, imbalance reporting, and invoice summary data. The EBB contains a Public Informational Postings (IP) component, compliant with NAESB data models and transaction standards, where customers can pull transactional reporting. The EBB interfaces to a parallel workstation Nominations and Scheduling Module for internal management, which contains added features for managing transactions (separate from the EBB client-oriented features) and permits retroactive data changes; whereas, the EBB prohibits transactions for any past date. The data entered in the workstation populates seamlessly into the EBB and vice versa.</p>

Marketers can post capacity to the EBB in compliance with NAESB standards.</p>
